    <h1>About Me</h1>

    <div class="about-text">
      <p>Hi! My name is Niko Orecchio, and I’m a recent graduate of Lafayette College with a degree in Economics, concentrating in Finance, and a minor in Data Science. I grew up in Old Tappan, NJ, and have always had a strong connection with my two brothers, with whom I share a love for sports and competition. Over the years, I developed a strong interest in finance, which has guided my academic and career path.</p>
      <p>At Lafayette, I was involved in the investment club, where I gained exposure to financial analysis and market research. My coursework in economics, finance, and data science helped me build a solid foundation in both theory and application. I also worked as an Associate Supervisor at the campus gym, where I balanced work with my studies and extracurricular activities.</p>
      <p>I’ve had the opportunity to complete internships in Private Equity and Financial Advising, where I learned about investment evaluation and client management. I’m also a CFA candidate and am currently awaiting my Level 1 results. To continue building my skills, I’ve taken additional courses like Wall Street Prep’s LBO Bootcamp and Bloomberg’s Market Concepts.</p>
      <p>Outside of work and academics, I enjoy playing pickup sports as well as distance running, skiing, and golf. I also own and operate a trading card reselling business on eBay.</p>
      <p>Feel free to browse through the site to learn more about my experiences and projects!</p>
